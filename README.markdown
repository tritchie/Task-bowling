# Life Bowling

The revolutionary life-bowling system, now online!

### Next Milestone:
* 10/8/2011: Pleasant-looking, bug-free, user-ready app

### Past Milestones:
* 10/4/2011: user-friendly UI
* 9/20/2011: functional app

## Questions:
####Technical
* how do I embed a link to a controller request?  I made an
ugly route and ugly game-controller action to allow inactive frames to
activate when clicked.
* I hear 'fat model' is good.  How do I validate the values
in relation to each other?  Use validate_each on just one value
and run a block full of side-effects?
* I can't figure out how to fix my test database!

####Design
* How do I want to combine views?
Call the models from a new 'Pages' controller and use a shared partial?
* Passing locals to partials: is it pretty much a trick to reduce complexity
when the app gets too huge?  Are there differing tastes here?  Should I imitate
our main codebase's style?

####Learning
* My tables are ugly and HTML attributes are uglier.
What's the most painless way to get a hang of this stuff?
